# Suicides 1985 - 2015

## Overview
The project aims to analyze global suicide trends from 1985 to 2015, utilizing SQL for in-depth data analysis. It focuses on identifying patterns, differences between countries, and the impact of socio-economic factors on suicide rates.

## SQL QUERIES
1. Suicides by age
   - This SQL query aggregates the number of suicides by age group for each year in the dataset. It categorizes suicides into seven age groups: 5-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-74 years, and 75+ years, using conditional aggregation to sum the number of suicides within each age category. The results are grouped by year and ordered in ascending order to analyze trends over time.
2. Suicides by gender
   - This SQL query calculates the annual number of suicides segmented by gender (male and female) from the table. It sums up the number of suicides for males and females separately for each year, grouping the results by year. The query is designed to provide insights into the gender distribution of suicides over time, with results ordered chronologically and limited to the first 31 years in the dataset
3. Suicides by generation
   - This SQL query aggregates the total number of suicides by generation from the table, summing up the suicides for each generation. The results are grouped by generation and ordered in descending order based on the number of suicides. This organization helps in understanding the impact of generational factors on suicide rates, highlighting which generations have the highest incidences of suicide.
4. Suicides per 100 k
   - This SQL query calculates the total number of suicides per 100,000 population for each country in the table. It sums up the suicides per 100k population across all years available for each country, groups the results by country, and orders them in descending order based on the suicide rate. This approach helps identify countries with the highest suicide rates per capita, providing a clear picture of geographical variations in suicide incidences.
